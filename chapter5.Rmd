## What's a data frame?

You may remember from the chapter about matrices that all the elements that you put in a matrix should be of the same type. Back then, your data set on Star Wars only contained numeric elements. 

When doing a market research survey, however, you often have questions such as:
- 'Are your married?' or 'yes/no' questions (`logical`)
- 'How old are you?' (`numeric`)
- 'What is your opinion on this product?' or other 'open-ended' questions (`character`)
- ...

The output, namely the respondents' answers to the questions formulated above, is a data set of different data types. You will often find yourself working with data sets that contain different data types instead of only one. 

A data frame has the variables of a data set as columns and the observations as rows. This will be a familiar concept for those coming from different statistical software packages such as SAS or SPSS.

## Quick, have a look at your data set

Wow, that is a lot of cars! 

Working with large data sets is not uncommon in data analysis. When you work with (extremely) large data sets and data frames, your first task as a data analyst is to develop a clear understanding of its structure and main elements. Therefore, it is often useful to show only a small part of the entire data set. 

So how to do this in R? Well, the function [`head()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/head) enables you to show the first observations of a data frame. Similarly, the function [`tail()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/head) prints out the last observations in your data set.

Both [`head()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/head) and [`tail()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/head) print a top line called the 'header', which contains the names of the different variables in your data set.

*** =instructions
Call [`head()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/head) on the [`mtcars`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/functions/mtcars) data set to have a look at the header and the first observations.

*** =hint
`head(mtcars)` will show the first observations of the `mtcars` data frame.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
# no pec

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Call head() on mtcars

```

*** =solution

# Call head() on mtcars
head(mtcars)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_function("head", "x", incorrect_msg = "Have you correctly passed `mtcars` to the `head()` function?")
test_output_contains("head(mtcars)", incorrect_msg = "Simply print out the result of the `head()` call, no need to assign it to a new variable.")
success_msg("Wonderful! So, what do we have in this data set? For example, `hp` for example represents the car's horsepower; the Datsun has the lowest horse power of the 6 cars that are displayed. For a full overview of the variables' meaning, type `?mtcars` in the console and read the help page. Continue to the next exercise!");
```


--- type:NormalExercise xp:100 skills:1
## Have a look at the structure

Another method that is often used to get a rapid overview of your data is the function [`str()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/str). The function [`str()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/str) shows you the structure of your data set. For a data frame it tells you:

- The total number of observations (e.g. 32 car types)
- The total number of variables (e.g. 11 car features)
- A full list of the variables names (e.g. `mpg`, `cyl` ... )
- The data type of each variable (e.g. `num`)
- The first observations

Applying the [`str()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/str) function will often be the first thing that you do when receiving a new data set or data frame. It is a great way to get more insight in your data set before diving into the real analysis.

*** =instructions
Investigate the structure of [`mtcars`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/functions/mtcars). Make sure that you see the same numbers, variables and data types as mentioned above.

*** =hint
Use the [`str()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/str) function on [`mtcars`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/functions/mtcars).

*** =pre_exercise_code

```{r}
test_output_contains("str(mtcars)", incorrect_msg = "Have you correctly called `str()` on `mtcars`?")
success_msg("Nice work! Can you find all the information that is listed in the exercise's assignment? Continue to the next exercise.")

## Creating a data frame 

Since using built-in data sets is not even half the fun of creating your own data sets, the rest of this chapter is based on your personally developed data set. Put your jet pack on because it is time for some space exploration! 

As a first goal, you want to construct a data frame that describes the main characteristics of eight planets in our solar system. According to your good friend Buzz, the main features of a planet are:

- The type of planet (Terrestrial or Gas Giant).
- The planet's diameter relative to the diameter of the Earth.
- The planet's rotation across the sun relative to that of the Earth.
- If the planet has rings or not (TRUE or FALSE).

After doing some high-quality research on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet), you feel confident enough to create the necessary vectors: `name`, `type`, `diameter`, `rotation` and `rings`; these vectors have already been coded up on the right. The first element in each of these vectors correspond to the first observation.

You construct a data frame with the [`data.frame()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/data.frame) function. As arguments, you pass the vectors from before: they will become the different columns of your data frame. Because every column has the same length, the vectors you pass should also have the same length. But don't forget that it is possible (and likely) that they contain different types of data.

*** =instructions
Use the function [`data.frame()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/data.frame) to construct a data frame. Pass the vectors `name`, `type`, `diameter`, `rotation` and `rings` as arguments to `data.frame()`, in this order. Call the resulting data frame `planets_df`.

*** =hint
Your `data.frame()` call starts as follows:
```
data.frame(planets, type, diameter)
```
Can you finish it?

*** =pre_exercise_code

## Creating a data frame (2)

The `planets_df` data frame should have 8 observations and 5 variables. It has been made available in the workspace, so you can directly use it.

*** =instructions
Use [`str()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/str) to investigate the structure of the new `planets_df` variable.

*** =hint
`planets_df` is already available in your workspace, so `str(planets_df)` will do the trick.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
load(url("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_r/planets.RData"))
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}

```{r}
# Check the structure of planets_df
str(planets_df)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
msg = "Do not remove or overwrite the `planets_df` data frame that is already available in the workspace!"
test_object("planets_df", undefined_msg = msg, incorrect_msg = msg)
test_output_contains("str(planets_df)", incorrect_msg = "Have you correctly displayed the structure of `planets_df`? Use `str()` to do this!")
success_msg("Awesome! Now that you have a clear understanding of the `planets_df` data set, it's time to see how you can select elements from it. Learn all about in the next exercises!")
```


--- type:NormalExercise xp:100 skills:1
## Selection of data frame elements

Similar to vectors and matrices, you select elements from a data frame with the help of square brackets `[ ]`. By using a comma, you can indicate what to select from the rows and the columns respectively. For example:

- `my_df[1,2]` selects the value at the first row and select element in `my_df`.
- `my_df[1:3,2:4]` selects rows 1, 2, 3 and columns 2, 3, 4 in `my_df`.

Sometimes you want to select all elements of a row or column. For example, `my_df[1, ]` selects all elements of the first row. Let us now apply this technique on `planets_df`!

*** =instructions
- From `planets_df`, select the diameter of Mercury: this is the value at the first row and the third column. Simply print out the result.
- From `planets_df`, select all data on Mars (the fourth row). Simply print out the result.

*** =hint
To select the diameter for Venus (the second row), you would need: `planets_df[2,3]`. What do you need for Mercury then?

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
load(url("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_r/planets.RData"))
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# The planets_df data frame from the previous exercise is pre-loaded

# Print out diameter of of Mercury (row 1, column 3)


# Print out data for Mars (entire fourth row)

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# The planets_df data frame from the previous exercise is pre-loaded

# Print out diameter of of Mercury (row 1, column 3)
planets_df[1,3]

# Print out data for Mars (entire fourth row)
planets_df[4, ]
```

*** =sct
```{r}
msg = "Do not remove or overwrite the `planets_df` data frame!"
test_object("planets_df", undefined_msg = msg, incorrect_msg = msg)
test_output_contains("planets_df[1,3]", incorrect_msg = "Have you correctly selected and printed out the diameter for Mercury? You can use `[1,3]`.")
test_output_contains("planets_df[4, ]", incorrect_msg = "Have you correctly selected and printed out all data for Mars? You can use `[4,]`.")
success_msg("Great! Apart from selecting elements from your data frame by index, you can also use the column names. To learn how, head over to the next exercise.")
```


--- type:NormalExercise xp:100 skills:1
## Selection of data frame elements (2)

Instead of using numerics to select elements of a data frame, you can also use the variable names to select columns of a data frame. 

Suppose you want to select the first three elements of the `type` column. One way to do this is

```
planets_df[1:3,1]
```

A possible disadvantage of this approach is that you have to know (or look up) the column number of `type`, which gets hard if you have a lot of variables. It is often easier to just make use of the variable name:

```
planets_df[1:3,"type"]
```

*** =instructions
Select and print out the first 5 values in the `"diameter"` column of `planets_df`.

*** =hint
You can select the first five values with `planets_df[1:5, ...]`. Can you fill in the `...` bit to only select the `"diameter"` column?

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
load(url("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_r/planets.RData"))
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# The planets_df data frame from the previous exercise is pre-loaded

# Select first 5 values of diameter column

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# The planets_df data frame from the previous exercise is pre-loaded

# Select first 5 values of diameter column
planets_df[1:5, "diameter"]
```

*** =sct
```{r}
msg = "Do not remove or overwrite the `planets_df` data frame!"
test_object("planets_df", undefined_msg = msg, incorrect_msg = msg)
test_output_contains("planets_df[1:5, \"diameter\"]", incorrect_msg = "Have you correctly selected the first five values from the diameter column and printed them out? You can use `[1:5, \"diameter\"]` here.")
success_msg("Nice! Continue to the next exercise!")
```


--- type:NormalExercise xp:100 skills:1
## Only planets with rings

You will often want to select an entire column, namely one specific variable from a data frame. If you want to select all elements of the variable `diameter`, for example, both of these will do the trick:

```
planets_df[,3]
planets_df[,"diameter"]
```

However, there is a short-cut. If your columns have names, you can use the `$` sign:

```
planets_df$diameter
```

*** =instructions
- Use the `$` sign to select the `rings` variable from `planets_df`. Store the vector that results as `rings_vector`.
- Print out `rings_vector` to see if you got it right.

*** =hint
`planets_df$diameter` selects the `diameter` column from `planets_df`; what do you need to select the `rings` column then?

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
load(url("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_r/planets.RData"))
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# planets_df is pre-loaded in your workspace

# Select the rings variable from planets_df
rings_vector <- 
  
# Print out rings_vector
```

*** =solution
```{r}
# planets_df is pre-loaded in your workspace

# Select the rings variable from planets_df
rings_vector <- planets_df$rings

# Print out rings_vector
rings_vector
```

*** =sct
```{r}
msg = "Do not remove or overwrite the `planets_df` data frame!"
test_object("planets_df", undefined_msg = msg, incorrect_msg = msg)
test_object("rings_vector",
            incorrect_msg = "Have you correctly selected the `rings` variable from `planets_df`? Use `$rings`. Store the result as `rings_vector`.")
test_output_contains("rings_vector", incorrect_msg = "Don't forget to print out `rings_vector` after you've created it!")
success_msg("Great! Continue to the next exercise and discover yet another way of subsetting!")
```


--- type:NormalExercise xp:100 skills:1
## Only planets with rings (2)

You probably remember from high school that some planets in our solar system have rings and others do not. But due to other priorities at that time (read: puberty) you can not recall their names, let alone their rotation speed, etc. 

Could R help you out?

If you type `rings_vector` in the console, you get:

```
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
```

This means that the first four observations (or planets) do not have a ring (`FALSE`), but the other four do (`TRUE`). However, you do not get a nice overview of the names of these planets, their diameter, etc. Let's try to use `rings_vector` to select the data for the four planets with rings. 

*** =instructions
The code on the right selects the `name` column of all planets that have rings. Adapt the code so that instead of only the `name` column, _all_ columns for planets that have rings are selected.

*** =hint
Remember that to select _all_ columns, you simply have to leave the columns part inside the `[ ]` empty! This means you'll need `[rings_vector, ]`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
load(url("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_r/planets.RData"))
rings_vector <- planets_df$rings
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# planets_df and rings_vector are pre-loaded in your workspace

# Adapt the code to select all columns for planets with rings
planets_df[rings_vector, "name"]
```

*** =solution
```{r}
# planets_df and rings_vector are pre-loaded in your workspace

# Adapt the code to select all columns for planets with rings
planets_df[rings_vector, ]
```

*** =sct
```{r}
msg <- "Do not remove or overwrite `planets_df` or `rings_vector`!"
test_object("planets_df", undefined_msg = msg, incorrect_msg = msg)
test_object("rings_vector", undefined_msg = msg, incorrect_msg = msg)
test_output_contains('planets_df[rings_vector, ]', incorrect_msg = "Have you correctly adapted the code to select _all_ columns for the planets that have rings? You can use `planets_df[rings_vector, ]`. Make sure to include the comma here, it's crucial!")

## Only planets with rings but shorter

So what exactly did you learn in the previous exercises? You selected a subset from a data frame (`planets_df`) based on whether or not a certain condition was true (rings or no rings), and you managed to pull out all relevant data. Pretty awesome! By now, NASA is probably already flirting with your CV ;-). 

Now, let us move up one level and use the function [`subset()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/subset). You should see the [`subset()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/subset) function as a short-cut to do exactly the same as what you did in the previous exercises. 

```
subset(my_df, subset = some_condition)
``` 

The first argument of [`subset()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/subset) specifies the data set for which you want a subset. By adding the second argument, you give R the necessary information and conditions to select the correct subset. 

The code below will give the exact same result as you got in the previous exercise, but this time, you didn't need the `rings_vector`!

```
subset(planets_df, subset = rings)
``` 

*** =instructions
Use `subset()` on `planets_df` to select planets that have a diameter smaller than Earth. Because the `diameter` variable is a relative measure of the planet's diameter w.r.t that of planet Earth, your condition is `diameter < 1`.

*** =hint
`subset(planets_df, subset = ...)` almost solves it; can you fill in the `...`?

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
load(url("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/intro_to_r/planets.RData"))
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# planets_df is pre-loaded in your workspace

# Select planets with diameter < 1

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# planets_df is pre-loaded in your workspace

# Select planets with diameter < 1
subset(planets_df, subset = diameter < 1)
```

*** =sct

msg = "Do not remove or overwrite the `planets_df` data frame!"
test_object("planets_df", undefined_msg = msg, incorrect_msg = msg)
test_correct({
  test_output_contains("subset(planets_df, subset = diameter < 1)", incorrect_msg = "Have you correctly specified the `subset = ...` part inside `subset()`. The condition in this case is `diameter < 1`. Simply print out the result.")  
}, {
  test_function("subset", args = "x", 
                not_called_msg = "Make sure to use the `subset()` function to perform the selection!",
                incorrect_msg = "The first argument you pass to `subset()` should be `planets_df`.")
})
success_msg("Great! Not only is the `subset()` function more concise, it is probably also more understandable for people who read your code. Continue to the next exercise.");

## Sorting

Making and creating rankings is one of mankind's favorite affairs. These rankings can be useful (best universities in the world), entertaining (most influential movie stars) or pointless (best 007 look-a-like).

In data analysis you can sort your data according to a certain variable in the data set. In R, this is done with the help of the function [`order()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/order). 

[`order()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/order) is a function that gives you the ranked position of each element when it is applied on a variable, such as a vector for example:

```
> a <- c(100, 10, 1000)
> order(a)
[1] 2 1 3
```

10, which is the second element in `a`, is the smallest elements, so 2 comes first in the output of `order(a)`. 100, which is the first element in `a` is the second smallest element, so 1 comes second in the output of `order(a)`.

This means we can use the output of `order(a)` to reshuffle `a`:
    
```
> a[order(a)]
[1]   10  100 1000
```

## Sorting your data frame

Alright, now that you understand the [`order()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/order) function, let us do something useful with it. You would like to rearrange your data frame such that it starts with the smallest planet and ends with the largest one. A sort on the `diameter` column.

- Call `order()` on `planets_df$diameter` (the `diameter` column of `planets_df`). Store the result as `positions`.
- Now reshuffle `planets_df` with the `positions` vector as row indexes inside square brackets. Keep all columns. Simply print out the result.
